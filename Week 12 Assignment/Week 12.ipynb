    "3B) In a sense the entropy of these functions measure the \"uncertainty\" of the outcome. By different probabilities you can be a little more certain on some outcomes than others. In this particular case, since we have 2 probabilities higher than the rest in the Y set, we are more certain of those outcomes. Comparitively, in the X set of probabilities, its a complete gamble on which will occur."
